          Jen Jayme is a seasoned, dynamic leader with 20+ years of experience in fundraising, 
          marketing and communications, and as of 2020, is expanding into add full-stack 
          web development.  </p> 

        <p>Jen is passionate about inspiring and empowering underdogs and helping them find 
          their voice: young people, small business owners, nonprofits and people who need a chance.
        </p>

        <p>
          She's done it for over 20 years, having served in leadership roles at some incredible social 
          impact organizations, including Community Action Marin, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Hispanic Scholarship Fund, 
          St. Vincent de Paul Society, Santa Clara University, Techbridge, hospitals in Sonoma County and 
          Spokane Washington, and educational institutions at high school elementary and university 
          levels (UC Berkeley and Montessori, Waldorf and Catholic schools). 
        </p> 

        <p>
          In her early career, Jen served as a consultant to nonprofits for San Francisco-based Laura
          Talmus Associates, then at a leading international firm, CCS Fundraising. Those roles gave her invaluable
          experience working closely with and learning from high net worth donors, veteran fundraisers, and
          extraordinary leaders at a broad range of philanthropic organizations. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Her work has included leading multi-million-dollar capital campaigns, establishing new 
          major gift and fundraising programs, rebranding and overhauling agency websites and communications, 
          and too many galas and fundraisers to count.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jen was raised in the projects of East Boston by a single mother who worked her way from welfare to
          being a homeowner/landlord, and a father who began supporting his family at the age of 12.  Both of 
          parents grew up in deep poverty and become the first in their family to earn a college degree. 
          Her career was shaped by childhood years in an inner-city neighborhood of concentrated poverty followed  
          by high school years in affluent Marin County, California; the stark contrast in opportunities and 
          culture between those communities had a profound impact on her.  Jen has a passionate commitment to creating 
          socioeconomic, racial and gender equity and a deep interest in youth development and trauma-informed 
          care. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Jen earned an undergraduate B.A. in English with Honors from U.C. Berkeley, and is currently 
          working toward a certificate in full-stack web development at an intensive Coding Boot Camp at UC Berkeley.
          She lives in Novato, in beautiful Marin County, with her husband and 11-year-old son. When not working, she enjoys 
          supporting her son's career as a champion martial arts athlete, as well as snowboarding, baking, 
          reading, tinkering, and painting.
