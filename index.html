      Also, how do I get the background behind the brand to be one color while the navbar is a different color?-->

        <p>I'm a seasoned, dynamic leader with 20+ years of experience in fundraising, 
          marketing and communications, and as of 2020, I'm thrilled to add full-stack 
          web development to my skillset. </p>
      
        <p>I'm passionate about inspiring and empowering underdogs and helping them find 
          their voice: young people, small business owners, nonprofits and people who need a chance.</p>

        <p>I've done it for more than 20 years. I've served in leadership roles at some incredible social 
          impact organizations, including Community Action Marin, Episcopal Community Services of 
          San Francisco, Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Bay Area, Hispanic Scholarship Fund, 
          St. Vincent de Paul Society, Santa Clara University Center for Science, Technology and 
          Society (now Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship), Techbridge (a national nonprofit 
          promoting STEM education for underrepresented girls), hospitals in Sonoma County and 
          Spokane Washington, and educational institutions at high school elementary and university 
          levels (UC Berkeley and Montessori, Waldorf and Catholic schools). </p> 

        <p>In my early career, I served as a consultant to nonprofits for San Francisco-based Laura
        Talmus Associates, then at an international firm, CCS Fundraising. Those roles gave me invaluable
        experience working closely with and learning from high net worth donors, veteran fundraisers, and
        extraordinary leaders at a broad range of philanthropic organizations. </p>
        
        <p>My work has included leading multi-million-dollar capital campaigns, establishing new 
          major gift and fundraising programs, rebranding and overhauling agency websites and communications, 
          and too many galas and fundraisers to count.</p>

        <p>I was raised in the projects of East Boston by a single mother who worked her way from welfare to
        being a homeowner/landlord, and a father who began supporting his family at the age of 12.  Both were
        brought up in poverty and become the first in their family to earn a college degree.  My career was 
        shaped by childhood years in an inner-city neighborhood of concentrated poverty followed by high 
        school years in affluent Marin County, California, and the stark contrast in opportunities and 
        culture I experienced between those communities. I have a passionate commitment to creating 
        socioeconomic, racial and gender equity, and a deep interest in youth development and trauma-informed 
        care. Above all, I believe we are here to lift each other up.</p>

        <p>I earned an undergraduate B.A. in English with Honors from U.C. Berkeley, and am currently working
          toward a certificate in full-stack web development at UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp. </p> 
          
         <p>I live in Novato, in beautiful Marin County, with my husband and 11-year-old son, a champion 
           martial arts athlete. When not working, I enjoy snowboarding, baking, reading, tinkering, and painting.</p>
